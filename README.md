### 📺 Video 3  
**Build a Supervised Learning Model from Scratch | Polynomial Regression with Gradient Descent in Python**  
A hands-on walkthrough building a simple regression model from scratch and visualizing the learning process using Python.  
▶️ [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/qcKl1bzla_o)

![Polynomial Regression Plot](video-3-polynomial-regression/polynomial_regression.png)

This video guides you through solving the following problem using gradient descent:

$
y_{pred} = w_1 \cdot x + w_2 \cdot x^2 + \text{bias}
$

This is a simple **polynomial regression** task, trained without the help of machine learning libraries — just raw Python and NumPy.

You'll learn how to:

- ✅ Understand polynomial regression intuitively  
- ✅ Implement gradient descent step by step  
- ✅ Visualize predictions using Plotly  
- ✅ Track model loss and improvement over time  
- ✅ Make predictions on unseen data  

🛠️ No scikit-learn. No shortcuts. Just hands-on learning to help you master the core ideas!
